If you are experiencing performance problems during Scoop installs—like high CPU usage, or file access denied errors—it's possible that an anti-malware or anti-virus program is scanning files as they are being extracted and installed.

### Windows Defender
You can exclude the directories that Scoop uses from realtime scanning by running this command as an administrator:

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$($env:programdata)\scoop", (resolve-path "~/scoop")
```
