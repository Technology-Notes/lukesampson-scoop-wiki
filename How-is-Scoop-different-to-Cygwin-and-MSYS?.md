The most concise comparison I've come across for these 2 projects is an answer by Mike Zick in [this thread](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=200506130821.11185.mszick%40morethan.org&forum_name=mingw-msys).

So to parallel this for Scoop:

Scoop is an installer
The goal of Scoop is to let you use Unix-y programs in a normal Windows environment

Using Scoop lets you achieve similar things to Cygwin and MSYS, but without having to learn about and use a separate environment. You can just keep doing what you're already doing but easily access the cross-platform tools you need.
