If you need to run multiple versions of Ruby or Python on the same computer, you can use `scoop reset` to switch between versions. If you're familiar with rbenv or RVM this is roughly similar, although with `scoop reset` you always need to switch version manually.

### Example
```powershell
scoop install ruby ruby19
ruby --version # -> ruby 1.9.3p448 (2013-06-27) [i386-mingw32]

# switch to ruby 2.0
scoop reset ruby
ruby --version # -> ruby 2.0.0p247 (2013-06-27) [x64-mingw32]

# switch back to 1.9.3
scoop reset ruby19
ruby --version # -> ruby 1.9.3p448 (2013-06-27) [i386-mingw32]
```

`scoop reset` re-installs shims for the app and updates environment variables according to the app manifest. You can switch between Ruby versions as many times as you likeâ€”both versions remain installed but one takes priority.

## Python
The same thing works for Python

```powershell
scoop install python27 python
python --version # -> Python 3.3.2

scoop reset python27
python --version # -> Python 2.7.5
```
